## Helsinki Open API 💎

👋
The up-to-date and standardized data, edited by our content experts, ensures consistency in communicating Helsinki’s services both in Finland and abroad. MyHelsinki Open API lets you flexibly filter the data for your needs, be it coordinates, opening hours, description texts or photos of different places, events or activities.

Find data in four languages, Finnish, English, Swedish and Chinese, and filter it based on categories or distance for example. The API is designed for flexible extraction of the specific sets of data that fit your needs including text attributes and a wide variety of photo material. Open data also enables local businesses in Helsinki to gain visibility in international sales and marketing channels.
